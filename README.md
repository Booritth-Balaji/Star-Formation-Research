# Star-Formation-Research
This is a compilation of my summer research project in the topic of studying star forming regions and analyzing methods to estimate their ages which was carried out under the guidance of Prof. Smitha Sumbramanian of Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India. 

This repo contains all the papers I have read and referenced in the "Reading Files" folder, the data that was used in the "Data" folder and all the LaTeX files pertaining to my presentation in the "Presentation Files" folder. 

All the code I've written for this project is also included in the repo ans individual jupyter notebooks. Each notebook has a code block explaining the aim and functioning of the code in that notebook.

TOPCAT is also included, which was the software that I used to cross match catalogues, the rest should be self explanatory.
